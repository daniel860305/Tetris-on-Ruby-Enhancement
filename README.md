This is a project from the course "Programming Languages, Part C" provided by University of Washington.

Building on a original Tetris game provided by the course ("tetris-original.rb"), enhanced version of Tetris game is built
to provide more functionalities in the game.

## Enhancement
There are three enhancements in the game:
	- Add 3 more regular pieces to the set of pieces to increase difficulty of the game.
	- A secret cheating function is added into the game to help you play longer.
	- A secret key-bindings to turn the pieces upside down, allowing you to adjust the orientation of the pieces faster.

Both secrets are technically not secrets, as you can easily find it in the "tetris-enhanced.rb" file.

## How to play the game
To run the game, you need to have Ruby and Ruby/tk on your system. 
I suggest you search through the internet to find the suitable version for your system 

1. Download all the files in the repo into your local directory.
2. Open the command prompt, navigate to the directory where you put your files in.
3. Type "ruby main.rb" to start the game.
4. If you want to play the original version, type "ruby main.rb original".
